  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Branch:</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create branch names that reflect the Userstory or defect. &lt;Userstory | Defect Number&gt;_&lt;Description&gt;
          For Ex: <code>B-46972_AOS_Save_And_Fetch</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create separate branch for each stories/defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let us ensure that we are not stepping on each other branches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete the remote branch as soon as a merge request is merged to master/develop branch. This ensures that no one is using outdated branches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you delete your branch, please ensure that feature branch is approved and merged to master
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete your local feature branch as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always watch for GitLab/Slack for new MRs and it status. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Rebase your branch if any previous MRs were approved and merged.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Approval:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will have minimum 2 approvers and maximum of 3 approvers per merge request. <b>It's always good to have extra pairs of eyes.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          To approve merge requests
          <ol>
            <li>
              Please checkout/switch to the merge request branch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do a unit test to ensure that any functionality isn't broken.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of client side MR, please ensure that we don't see any JS errors on the console.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a detailed review at the code. This is to ensure that erroneous code getting into codebase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please take MRs as high priority and provide your approval ASAP.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Review:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reviews make our codebase stronger, error free and fool proof.
        </li>
        <li>
          Approach review comments positively. Review comments aren't to point fingers on others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide code snippets in comments wherever you feel comments can't express your idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          By reviewing others work, you are getting a different dimension of coding constructs. The more you review the more you learn.
