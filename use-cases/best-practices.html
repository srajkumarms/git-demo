  <h3>Best Practices</h3>
  <h4>
    <i>
      These are some best practices that we can adhere to for our project. Best practices are not limited to this list and any suggesstions to improve the process 
      will be added to the list.
    </i>
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Branch:</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create branch names that reflect the Userstory or defect. &lt;Userstory | Defect Number&gt;_&lt;Description&gt;
          For Ex: <code>B-46972_AOS_Save_And_Fetch</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create separate branch for each stories/defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let us ensure that we are not stepping on each other branches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete the remote branch as soon as a merge request is merged to master/develop branch. This ensures that no one is using outdated branches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you delete your branch, please ensure that feature branch is approved and merged to master
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete your local feature branch as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always watch for GitLab/Slack for new MRs and it status. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Rebase your branch if any previous MRs were approved and merged.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Commits:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Like branch names, prefix commit message with task id. &lt;Task ID&gt;_&lt;Task Description&gt;
          For Ex: <code>TK-101860_Create ingestion logic to push data to MainLine table.</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Commit message with taks ID helps to relate commits to story tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can commit any number of times with the same commit message as long as it is relevant. This ensures that you are not missing your local changes at any given point of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can squash one or more relevant commits just in case if you want to make it as single commit.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Approval:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will have minimum 2 approvers and maximum of 3 approvers per merge request. <b>It's always good to have extra pairs of eyes.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          To approve merge requests
          <ol>
            <li>
              Please checkout/switch to the merge request branch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do a unit test to ensure that any functionality isn't broken.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of client side MR, please ensure that we don't see any JS errors on the console.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a detailed review at the code. This is to ensure that erroneous code getting into codebase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please take MRs as high priority and provide your approval ASAP.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Review:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Reviews and comments aren't to point fingers on others.</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reviews make our codebase stronger, error free and fool proof.
        </li>
        <li>
          Approach review comments positively.
        </li>       
        <li>
          By reviewing others work, you are getting a different dimension of coding constructs. <b>The more you review the more you learn.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide code snippets in comments wherever you feel comments can't express your idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make necessary changes as per the review comments, check-in the changes, respond to comment and close it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reviews need not be once per MR. In case, the comment is misunderstood or further code optimization can be done, the whole review process shall continue.
        </li>
        <li>
